A system for managing different types of vehicles in a rental service
Enhance the Student Management System by implementing exception handling and multithreading to ensure safe execution and responsiveness. The system should handle invalid input (such as marks outside the valid range or empty fields) using try-catch-finally blocks and custom exceptions like StudentNotFoundException. Additionally, the system should simulate a loading process when adding or saving student data by using multithreading. The program should utilize wrapper classes (such as Integer, Double) for data conversion and autoboxing where applicable, providing a robust and responsive user interface for managing student records.
